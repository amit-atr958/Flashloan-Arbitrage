# Flashloan Arbitrage Bot

A complete, production-ready flashloan arbitrage bot for Ethereum that automatically detects and executes profitable arbitrage opportunities across multiple DEXs using Aave V3 flashloans.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-DEX Support**: Integrates with Uniswap V2/V3, SushiSwap, Balancer, Curve, and 1inch
- **Aave V3 Flashloans**: Uses Aave V3 for zero-collateral flashloans
- **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket connections for low-latency price monitoring
- **Atomic Transactions**: Guaranteed no-loss execution with automatic revert on failure
- **Gas Optimization**: Smart gas price management and execution timing
- **Configurable**: Fully configurable via environment variables
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive logging, error handling, and monitoring

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm or yarn
- Ethereum wallet with ETH for gas fees
- RPC provider (Alchemy/Infura recommended)
- Etherscan API key (for contract verification)

## üõ† Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd flashloan-arbitrage-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual values
   ```

4. **Compile contracts**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Edit `.env` file with your configuration:

```env
# Blockchain Connection
PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234...  # Your wallet private key
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_key
RPC_URL=wss://eth-mainnet.ws.alchemyapi.io/v2/your_alchemy_key

# Contract
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1234...  # Deployed contract address

# Trading Parameters
MIN_PROFIT_USD=50           # Minimum profit to execute
MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=100     # Maximum gas price
SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE=0.5     # Slippage tolerance %

# API Keys
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_key
```

### DEX Configuration

Modify `config/dex-config.json` to:
- Add/remove DEX routers
- Configure token pairs
- Adjust trading parameters
- Set network-specific settings

## üöÄ Deployment

### 1. Deploy to Testnet (Recommended First)

```bash
# Deploy to Goerli testnet
npm run deploy:testnet
```

### 2. Deploy to Mainnet

```bash
# Deploy to Ethereum mainnet
npm run deploy
```

### 3. Verify Contract

```bash
npm run verify
```

The deployment script will:
- Deploy the FlashloanArbitrage contract
- Configure initial DEX routers
- Save deployment info to `deployments/` folder
- Verify contract on Etherscan

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Bot

### Start Monitoring

```bash
npm start
# or
npm run monitor
```

The bot will:
1. Connect to Ethereum via WebSocket
2. Start monitoring prices across all configured DEXs
3. Scan for arbitrage opportunities every 2 seconds
4. Execute profitable trades automatically
5. Log all activities to console and files

### Monitor Logs

```bash
# View real-time logs
tail -f logs/combined.log

# View error logs
tail -f logs/error.log
```

## üìä How It Works

### 1. Price Monitoring
- Connects to multiple DEXs via their router contracts
- Fetches real-time price data for all token pairs
- Updates price cache every 5 seconds
- Uses WebSocket for low-latency data

### 2. Arbitrage Detection
- Compares prices across all DEX pairs
- Calculates potential profit after gas costs
- Filters opportunities by minimum profit threshold
- Accounts for slippage and flashloan fees

### 3. Execution Process
- Requests flashloan from Aave V3
- Executes buy order on cheaper DEX
- Executes sell order on expensive DEX
- Repays flashloan + fees
- Keeps profit in contract

### 4. Safety Mechanisms
- Transaction reverts if unprofitable
- Gas price limits prevent high-cost execution
- Execution cooldown prevents spam
- Emergency stop functionality

## üîß Smart Contract Architecture

### FlashloanArbitrage.sol

The main contract inherits from:
- `FlashLoanSimpleReceiverBase` (Aave V3)
- `Ownable` (Access control)
- `ReentrancyGuard` (Security)

Key functions:
- `executeOperation()`: Flashloan callback
- `requestFlashLoan()`: Initiate arbitrage
- `addDEX()`/`removeDEX()`: Manage DEX routers
- `withdrawToken()`/`withdrawETH()`: Owner functions

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### Bot Status
The bot logs status every 60 seconds:
- Wallet balance
- Active price data entries
- Last execution time
- Uptime statistics

### Profit Tracking
- All executions logged with profit/loss
- Gas costs tracked
- Success/failure rates
- Performance metrics

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Private Key Security
- Use a dedicated wallet for the bot
- Never commit private keys to version control
- Consider using hardware wallets for production
- Implement key rotation policies

### Smart Contract Security
- Contract is upgradeable by owner only
- Emergency withdrawal functions
- Reentrancy protection
- Input validation on all functions

### Operational Security
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Set reasonable profit thresholds
- Use private RPC endpoints if possible
- Implement alerting for failures

## üß™ Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Test on Fork
```bash
# Test against mainnet fork
npx hardhat test --network hardhat
```

### Gas Analysis
```bash
REPORT_GAS=true npm test
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Insufficient funds" error**
   - Ensure wallet has enough ETH for gas
   - Check if contract has required token balances

2. **"Transaction reverted" error**
   - Arbitrage became unprofitable during execution
   - Gas price too high
   - DEX liquidity changed

3. **"Connection failed" error**
   - Check RPC endpoint status
   - Verify API keys
   - Check network connectivity

4. **"No opportunities found"**
   - Market conditions may not be favorable
   - Adjust profit thresholds
   - Check DEX configurations

### Debug Mode
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug npm start
```

## üìö Advanced Configuration

### Custom DEX Integration
1. Add router address to `config/dex-config.json`
2. Implement swap logic in contract
3. Update monitoring system

### MEV Protection
```env
# Use private RPC endpoint
PRIVATE_RPC_URL=your_private_endpoint

# Enable Flashbots integration
FLASHBOTS_RELAY_URL=https://relay.flashbots.net
```

### Performance Optimization
- Use dedicated RPC endpoints
- Implement connection pooling
- Optimize gas estimation
- Use multicall for batch operations
